# Python OOP Challenge: Digital Pet

Welcome to this submission for the **Python OOP Digital Pet Challenge**!  
This project is all about practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating a customizable virtual pet in Python.

---

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main Python files:

- `pet.py`: Contains the `Pet` class with attributes and methods.
- `main.py`: Runs the program, allowing the user to interact with their pet.

The virtual pet has a **name**, **hunger**, **energy**, **happiness**, and can even learn new **tricks**! üêæ

## Features Implemented

1. Customizable pet name  
2. OOP concepts: Classes, Constructors, Attributes, and Methods  
3. Methods:
 `eat()`: Reduces hunger and boosts happiness
 `sleep()`: Increases energy
 `play()`: Affects energy, hunger, and happiness
 `train(trick)`: Teaches a new trick
 `show_tricks()`: Displays learned tricks
 `get_status()`: Shows current stats
